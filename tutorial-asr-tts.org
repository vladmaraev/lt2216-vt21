* Automatic speech recognition
*ASR applications*
- fixed commands
- grammars (e.g. date)
- continuous speech recognition (huge vocabulary)

*What is ASR*:
- The aim is to decode the acoustic signal *X* into a word sequence *Ŵ*
  which is hopefully close to original word sequence *W*.
- We need an *acoustic model* that represent our knowledge about acoustics, phonetics, microphone, environment, speakers, dialects, etc.
- And a *language model*, that knows about words (and non-words), how they co-occur and form sequences (utterances)

*Variability in speech*
- context variability (/pin/ vs /spin/), coarticulation
- style variability (“Ford or” vs “Four door”), easier in isolation
- speaker variability (more than 500 speakers for speaker-independent
  ASR)
- environment variability

*Formal definition*
- The aim is to decode the acoustic signal *X* into a word sequence *Ŵ*
  which is hopefully close to original word sequence *W*.
- We can observe the set of parameters *O* (observations) for the
  acoustic signal.
- In the following equation acoustic model would be responsible for P(O|W) and language model for P(W)
  
\[
W = \argmax_W P(W | O) = \argmax_W \frac{P(O|W)P(W)}{P(O)} = \argmax_W P(O|W)P(W)
\]

*But how do we calculate P(O|W)?*
- Can we use words? Yes, but then there will be a huge range of
  observations.
- We can minimise the number of possible observations? Yes, by selecting some smaller phonetic units.


*Why word is not a good unit:*
- New task can have new words but we won’t have any training data.
- There are too many words, and each of them has too many acoustic realisations. 

*Good unit is:*
- *accurate*, to represent acoustic realisation in different contexts
- *trainable*, we should have enough data to estimate the parameters of
  the unit
- *generalisable*, so new word could be derived from our units

*What about phonemes?*
- Just 50 phones in English, no problem to train.
- They are vocabulary-independent.
- But phonemes are not produced independently, they are
  context-dependent, so they can over-generalise.
- For some languages we can use syllables (1200 in Chinese, 50 in
  Japanese) but for English (30k+) training is challenging.

*How can we capture context dependency?*
- A *triphone* phonetic model: it takes into consideration the left and
  the right contexts.
- They capture coarticulation.
- Features: typically 

*Different but similar*
- It is desirable to find instances of similar contexts and merge
  them.
- This would lead to a much more managable number of models that can
  be trained.
- We can use phonetic Hidden Markov Models (HMM) as the basic subphonetic unit.

*Phonetic HMMs*
- Another challenge: variable length of observations for each phoneme.
- HMM can describe how states (set of features) are distributed in the
  phoneme.
- We observe only the acoustic features, but the states are hidden.

*ASR architecture*
- frames (10ms), feature extraction
- Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are used as an input to
  individual Gaussian distribution for each phone
- models (e.g. HMM model of a senone)
- decoding is integral path: the process which transforms the signal
  into word hypotheses.

*ASR decoding*:
- Using Viterbi or other methods, multiple ‘top’ hypotheses can remain
- The possible outcomes can be stored in a *word-confusion network*
  (sausage) or a *lattice*.

*Evaluation*
- Levenshtein distance/alignment
- $WER = \frac{S + D + I}{N}$

*Incrementalising ASR*
- We need incremental ASR, which would require incrementalising all
  the internal processes.
- We need incremental LMs and AMs, in order to get the best sequences unit-by-unit.
- It is critical that ASR will provide timing for recognised words in a timely manner.

*ASR should support disfluencies*
- e.g. “have the engine [ take the oranges to Elmira, + { um, I mean, } take them to Corning ] ” (Core and Schubert 1999)
- ‘um’ and ‘uh’ should be considered English words
- it is important to have access to “the oranges” in ASR output
- incremental disfluency detector (Hough and Purver, 2014)

*Incremental evaluation (Baumann et al., 2017[fn::Baumann, T., Kennington, C., Hough, J., & Schlangen, D. (2017). Recognising conversational speech: What an incremental asr should do for a dialogue system and how to get there. In Dialogues with Social Robots (pp. 421-432). Springer, Singapore.]) I* 
+ Utterance-level Accuracy and Disfluency Suitability
  - WER disfluency gain to determine how much of disfluent material is recovered
+ Timing: first occurence (FO) and final decision (FD):
  - FO is the time between the (true) beginning of a word and the
    first time it occurs in the output (regardless if it is
    afterwards changed)
  - FD is the time between the (true) end of a word and the time when
    the recognizer decides on the word, without later revising it
    anymore.

*Incremental evaluation (Baumann et al., 2017) II* 
+ Diachronic Evolution: how often consuming processors have to
  re-consider their output and for how long hypotheses are likely to
  still change. 
  - stability of the hypotheses. For words that are added and later
    revoked or substituted we measure the “survival time” and report
    aggregated plots of word survival rate (WSR) after a certain age.


* TTS and speech synthesis
*TTS challenges*
- From the last lecture: coarticulation
- Text normalisation
- Homography
- Code-switching (and borrowed words)
- Morphology

*Text normalisation*
- abbreviations and acronyms: Dr., DC, NASA, COVID-19
- number formats, e.g. IBM 370, dates, times and currencies
- ~, Ü, *, "", UPPER CASE, :-)

*Homograph disambiguation*
- Homograph variation can often be resolved on PoS (grammatical)
  category, e.g. /object/, /bass/, /absent/, /-ate/
- But sometimes PoS does not help, e.g. /read, /kinda/
- Variation of dialects
- Rate of speech (e.g. ‘g’ in /recognise/)

*What is TTS:*
- text and phonetic analysis, grapheme-to-phoneme
- prosody
- speech synthesis

*Prosody*:
- speaking style (character and emotion)
- symbolic prosody (pauses, punctuation)
- accent and stress
- tone (e.g. yn- vs. wh-questions)

*Speech synthesis*
- Articulatory synthesis (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR41CRbIjV4)
- Rule-based formant synthesis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZh6ZYYqLJc, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECtalk][DECtalk]]
- Concatenative synthesis
- Statistical parametric synthesis (generative synthesis)  
- Deep learning-based synthesis

*Concatenative synthesis* (or unit-selection)
- Searches for the best sequence of (variably sized) units of speech
  in a large, annotated corpus of recordings, aiming to find a
  sequence that closely matches the target sequence.
- Sounds good if you fit the bits well. Also can be tuned.
- Can be really expensive to build: need professional speakers, many
  hours of stable recordings.

*Statistical parametric speech synthesis*
- Essentially, reproduces the speech signal.
- Break speech into several factors and represent it as numbers.
- Learn the model from data.
- From the model we can generate a spectrogram and then create a waveform.

*HMM speech synthesis*
- HMM consists of a) sequence model: a weighted finite state network
  of states and transitions 2) observation model: multivariate
  Gaussian distribution in each state
- HMM has many decision-tree context-dependent triphones and three
  states per triphone.
- Generates most likely sequence for the given phoneme(s).
- A global optimisation then computes a stream of vocoding features
  that optimise both HMM emission probabilities and continuity
  constraints.

*Neural speech synthesis*
- text to features
- features to sound (neural vocoder)
- sequence2sequence models (e.g. RNN, GRU)
- e.g. LPCNet, WaveNet

*Some advanced matters*
- adapting voices, by changing a few parameters in the model
- repairing voices

- Incrementality: INPRO_iSS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwNvcUXfD7Y

*Evaluation*
- Intelligibility tests, e.g. rhyme tests
- Quality tests: mean opinion scores (MOS) and preference test
- Functional tests
- Automated tests, mainly for letter-to-sound or prosody
